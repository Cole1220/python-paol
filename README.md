## REFACTOR UNDERWAY
#### This will LIKELY not work until refactor is done
#### I will try to update readme as I go with refactor

## Setup
1. Install Python3
    + https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NRWMJP3717K?ocid=pdpshare
2. Run ./scripts/install.py
    + Updates python
    + Installs all components needed

## How to Use - (Currently not usable)
1. Run launch.py

#### TODO:
1. Add install scripts for linux and mac
2. Make easier executing of py files 


## Working Things
1. scripts/install.py on Windows
2. launch.py will launch the new (in progress) settings window
3. camera are found and switchable (probably, i only have one camera)
